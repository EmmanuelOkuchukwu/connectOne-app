# MERN BLOG
The Mern StoryTime Web Application is a blog web app that is in the process of being developed. The web app allows the users to register for an account, login, create, read, update and delete posts, and comments that the users posts. This initial purpose of this web application was just a fun side project for me to learn and develop my skills in both frontend and backend but I've been inspired to push for more features to be implemented, and I will eventually deploy this project to heroku in the near future.

Features/requirements:
User must register for an account in order gain access to the application.

User must login to use create and view their posts.

User can create a new post, and view their posts

User can update their posts.

User can delete their post.

Future features:
    
    I want to develope a chatting feature for this app in the feature.
    
    I want the users to be able to reply to someone's comments.

    There will be a sort tasks filter that can filter out tasks according to the order the user wants to sort them out.
    
    I want to add pagination to the post page.
    
    I also want to implement the like and dislike feature on the frontend.
    
    I also want to add an admin panel where the admin can create new categories and even manage users.
